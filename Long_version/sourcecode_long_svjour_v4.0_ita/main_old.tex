\title{Parameterizing Higher-order Processes on Names and Processes
\thanks{A preliminary version of this work was presented at EXPRESS/SOS 2016. %Comparatively, 
This paper revises and extends that version with full-fledged proofs and more refined discussions (at least more than half new materials), and moreover, the detailed analysis of a variant encoding of interest. This encoding, mentioned only as a further direction in the preliminary version, is given thorough examination in this work.}

\begin{abstract}
Parameterization extends higher-order processes with the capability of abstraction and application (like those in lambda-calculus). As is well-known, this extension is strict, 
%i.e., higher-order processes equipped with parameterization are computationally more expressive. 
\xxxx{meaning that higher-order processes equipped with parameterization are strictly more expressive than those without parameterization. 
}
This paper studies strictly higher-order processes (i.e., no name-passing) with two kinds of parameterization: one on names and the other on processes themselves. We present two main results. One is that in presence of parameterization, higher-order processes can interpret first-order (name-passing) processes in a quite elegant fashion, in contrast to the fact that higher-order processes without parameterization cannot encode first-order processes at all. We present two such encodings and analyze their properties in depth, particularly full abstraction. In the other result, we provide a simpler characterization of the standard context \xxxx{bisimilarity} for higher-order processes with parameterization, in terms of the normal \xxxx{bisimilarity} that stems from the well-known normal characterization for higher-order calculus. 
\xxxx{As a spinoff, we show that the bisimulation up-to context technique is sound in the higher-order setting with parameterization.}
%These results demonstrate more essence of the parameterization method in the higher-order paradigm toward expressiveness and behavioural equivalence.
