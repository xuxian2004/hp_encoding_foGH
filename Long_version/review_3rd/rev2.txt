** Summary **

This paper studies the relationship between the pi-calculus and the higher-order pi-calculus equipped with parameterization. The ability to pass processes 
that are parameterized is called in the literature 'abstraction-passing'.

The contribution of the paper could be summarized as follows: name-passing can be emulated with the ability to pass processes that are parameterized over names and processes.
The author also provides a characterization of context bisimulation as normal form bisimulation for this calculus with parameterization, as it has been done for similar 
calculi. 


** Evaluation **

The paper is poorly written, and sometimes sloppy in its conception. There are many examples of incorrect english or poorly phrased 
explanations, some of which are in the 'minor comments' section below. There are too many, however, to be exhaustive. Some technical issues 
are also discussed below.

The main idea is quite natural: we can reasonably expect to capture name passing by having abstraction-passing, for both names and processes.
However, the author already published a paper [2] showing name passing can be encoded through abstraction-passing, with only name abstractions. 
Therefore, there is really no surprise in the main results. The encodings presented in the paper are more natural, more concise; but this is not 
clear to me anything meaningful has been accomplished in this paper.

Furthermore, the results regarding normal form bisimulation are already known for abstraction-passing calculi, with just one type of abstraction. 
Therefore, it is clear that by adding constructs to the language, thus making the contexts stronger, this characterisation would still hold
(the addition of a new type of abstraction does not change the bisimulation itself).

A lot of the proofs do not seem meaningful, and consist of just sequences of algebraic calculations.
Those proofs could go in an appendix, however I am not convinced much would be left.

I would advise against publication. For me, to be even considered, the paper should be almost entirely rewritten, and some convincing arguments 
should be given about its contribution and novelty.


** Technical issues **

The use of structural congruence to define abstraction and application (and substitution) is a problem: 
with such a rule, it is very easy to build an infinite derivation tree.

Care has also to be taken in order to ensure that the 'normalization' of a substitution terminates.
In [1], Sangiorgi uses a sorting/type system to ensure that substitutions terminate.
It would seem important here, however it is barely refered to. 
Otherwise it is possible to write a diverging terms: <X>(X<X>)<<Y>(Y<Y>)> (this is basically Omega).

** General comments **

The proof of a lemma or theorem should be right after its statement, not after other lemmas, or 
a page of additional explanations.

"Bisimulation" is sometimes used instead of "bisimilarity".


About 'computational expressiveness': 
"higher-order processes equipped with parameterization are computationally more expressive."
"it appears reasonable for such an extension to be able to
express first-order processes since lambda-calculus is universal in computation."

I'm not sure I understand these remarks; what does "computational expressiveness" mean here? 
I assume it is not computability. Furthermore, the lambda-calculus can be encoded 
in the higher-order pi-calculus, so I'm not sure what this means.


** Minor comments **


p.2

Incorrect use of "i.e.":

"but is very hard to analyze for
full abstraction (i.e., the first-order processes are equivalent if and only if their
encodings are; the ‘if only’ direction is called soundness and the other direc-
tion is called completeness)."



"the encoding has a correct operational correspondence (i.e., the correspondence between
the processes before and after the encoding),"
-> We establish an operational correspondence between the reductions of a process and its encoding.
(incorrect use of "i.e.")

p.3

"This encoding depends heavily on the notions of ‘localized’ which means only
the output capability of a name can be communicated during interactions, and
‘asynchronous’ which means the output is non-blocking."
-> This encoding relies heavily on output capability ... 


"Though technically a nice reference, intuitively because this variant of π-calculus is less expressive
than the full π-calculus, it is not very surprising that the higher-order processes
with parameterization on names can interpret it faithfully, i.e., fully abstract
with respect to barbed congruence."
-> remove

"In that effort, which somewhat precipitates the work here, [...]"
To that end, [...]. This inspired the present work.

"This question is important in two aspects."
-> respects

p.4

bisimulation is used but not explained


"here | denotes concurrency,"
-> We write | for the parallel composition

"E[A] means putting A in the environment E."
-> E[A] is a shorthand for E where the hole [.] is substituted by A.

"To meet this challenge, a crucial so-called factorization theorem is used to circumvent technical difficulty."
-> A crucial ingredient is a 

"how normal bisimulation is designed in the basic higher-order processes."

"In particular, the factorization states the following property,"


p.5

"(i.e., not clear if the characterization remains true in a strictly higher-order setting without name-passing),"
Incorrect use of i.e.

"Such kind of encoding"
-> This kind of encoding

p. 7

"2.1 Calculus π"
-> $\pi$-calculus


"Usually closed processes are considered by default"
In pi, I'm don't think it makes a lot of sense.


p.12
"We define a notion of encoding"

p.14

Example:
Put the example in an "example" block.

Conclusion:

"proper uniform-looking ‘trigger’"
Does not make much sense to me

p. 18

"the soundness of the encoding is not true."
-> the encoding is not sound 


p. 22

"though its properties are not
clear before this work 1"
-> were not clear?
-> avoid footnote


"This encoding was suggested by Alan Schmitt 
during the communication concerning
another work."
-> "when discussing a different subject"?
-> no point in that: just say the encoding was 
suggested by A. Schmitt


p. 28

"For the sake of conciseness, we use · to denote certain existent process."
-> Here, . is some unspecified process.

p.29

"To summary,"
-> To summarize


p. 33
"(i) if E[Trm] is <U>E' for some non-abstraction 
E' (here and below, <U> 
denotes the abstractions prefixing E ), then..."
-> Simply replace E[Trm] by <~U>E[Trm] so you don't need E'...
It feels like we should assume <~U>E' to be closed or something similar here. 


"(ii) particularly, if E[T r m ] is not an abstraction, then..."
Remove this


p.34 

"The proof is similar to those in the references [2, 22, 29, 34]."
-> is similar to the congruence proofs in [2,...]

"We note that although we have a new form of triggers here, the proof approach is exactly the
same."
Not very useful.
The whole paragraph should be rewritten.

p. 35
"We only need to prove ≈_nr implies ≈_ct , since ≈ ct is obviously finer than ≈_nr."
Explain why.


"and leave out the similar (and simpler) rest."
-> leave out the other cases.
